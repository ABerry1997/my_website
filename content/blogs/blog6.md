#From the countryside to the big city

Originally from the countryside in Scotland, I've always been attracted to the opportunities and excitement offered by big cities. After playing professional football for a year I attended university in Washington , D.C. on an athletic scholarship , affording me a unique opportunity to experience life abroad in a diverse city. After 4 great years of studying and a year of working in the capital I decided it was time to come back to the UK and cannot wait to explore the opportunities offered by London Business School and London as a whole. 

##Hobbies

Unfortunately with the current coronavirus situation I can't pursue one of my biggest hobbies: travelling. There's nothing better to me than exploring somewhere I've never been before and I can't wait to hop back on a plane. Growing up close to the ocean I've always been fascinated by whats below and soon I became a big fan of scuba diving. I'm lucky to have dived in Malaysia, Costa Rica and Portugal and can't wait to explore the depths of other countries. I'm also learning to speak Spanish at the moment and hope to eventually become fluent through the help of Spanish TV and my Spanish roommate!
